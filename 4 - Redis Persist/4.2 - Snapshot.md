With snapshot, we can create a point-in-time when a dump is performed, it will save the latest data to disk
- We can use ```BGSAVE``` to initialize a save, a child process will be forked and write snapshot to disk
- Another solution is ```SAVE``` command, it will stop from any read/write and save data to disk. Only use this option when we do not have much memory.
- configure when to take snapshot: ```save 60 10000```
- When being ```SHUT DOWN```, Redis will perform a ```SAVE``` command

# Considering BIG DATA
For 50gb of data, running on 68gb machine, Redis takes 15 seconds to fork and 15-20 minutes followed to take the snapshot running by ```BGSAVE```.

For normal ```SAVE```, Redis do not need to fork child process, and no fork-delay, Redis takes 3-5 minutes to snapshot that amount of data

To keep more data up-to-date, we should use append-only file persistence
