When writing files to disk, at least three things occur
- Writing to a buffer: ```file.write()```. When data is in the buffer, the OS can take that data and write to disk on the future
- ```file.flush()```, which make a request to the OS to write the file to disk
- perform a ```sync```, which block the file until writing is completed

### Some options with ```appendfsync```
- always: every write command will write to disk
- everysec: Once per second
- no: let the OS decide when to sync to disk

**Note**: ```appendfsync always``` will much rely on disk performance, which can be 200 writes/second for HDD and a few tens of thousand for SSD. So to keep balance, we should use ```everysec``` option
